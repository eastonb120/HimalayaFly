Version that was based on our main branch (Official Version)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In order to run the final version "PythonTeam2_Final_QuickSort_Main.py" you will need to run from command line:

python PythonTeam2_Final_QuickSort_Main.py InventoryManifest.csv <sortedOutputFile>.csv



How to grab cProfile Stats
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
main.py doesn't require command line args. This was forked from "PythonTeam2_Final_QuickSort_Main.py" prior to
implementing command line args.

To see an output from cProfile, please run "main.py". In Linux, we did the following (I'm sure you know
 but just want to cover our bases):

python main.py >> <profileOutputFile>.txt

Fow Windows, we ran "main.py" in IDLE and then copied the cProfile results into a text file.
